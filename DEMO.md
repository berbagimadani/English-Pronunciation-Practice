## Customization Examples

### Adding New Lessons
```typescript
// In src/App.tsx
{
  id: '4',
  title: 'Travel English',
  difficulty: 'intermediate',
  sentences: [
    'Where is the nearest airport?',
    'I would like to book a hotel room.',
    'How much does this cost?'
  ]
}
```

### Changing Color Scheme
```javascript
// In tailwind.config.js
colors: {
  primary: {
    500: '#your-color',
    600: '#your-darker-color',
  }
}
```

## Production Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment Considerations
- Requires HTTPS for speech recognition in production
- Microphone permissions needed
- Modern browser requirement
- CDN-friendly static files

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. Check browser compatibility
2. Allow microphone permissions
3. Ensure HTTPS in production
4. Test microphone hardware

### Styling Issues
1. Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. Check PostCSS configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Performance Issues
1. Use production build for testing
2. Check network connection for font loading
3. Optimize images if added
